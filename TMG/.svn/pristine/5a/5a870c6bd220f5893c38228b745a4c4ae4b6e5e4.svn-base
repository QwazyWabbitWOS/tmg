CHANGELOG FOR TMG_MOD

r32:
Fixed double+ rails to check to see if player hit was an enemy before adding it to number of players hit.
Fixed yes votes not clearing on mapvote fail.
Fixed oplist/listops command to display ops correctly.
Added sounds for double+ rails and some more sounds sprees/headshots.
Added "rconmode" admin command for binding a key to enter rcon commands in messagemode.
Added displaying of maplist for available maps to vote on when client types mapvote with no option.

r36:
Changed yes/no vote commands to not set the client's vote to yes or no until a vote is in progress.
Added new CVAR: 'cfgdir'. You may want to run multiple servers from the same directory. This allows you to set
  those servers up independently. Please note that you must have a logs, nav, ent, and hs folder in each cfg directory. This
  is changed to read from cfg directory instead of the game directory. Also the bot_detected.txt is now bot_detected.log
  and will be in your logs directory. Also this is a noset cvar and must be set from the command line when starting the server.
Mapvoting is now available via client menu. Also choosing yes or no to vote is in same menu.
Fixed mapvote client command to not exec during map voting for end of level.
Added End of Level map change vote to client menu.

r37:
Debugging step build

r38:
Fixed highscores causing a crash in Linux servers with long map names.

r39:
Fixed map nicks being too long screwing up op and vote maplist menus.

r40-42:
Code/SVN Repo Maintenance







Completed
2. Player name on freecam was fixed, but I may have to fix it again so it&#39;s still on the list.
3. Same with bug in lockteams on the admin menu.
4. Make highscores available anytime via a console cmd.
21. Kill/Death counter. I did this once already but think it needs done again.


Not Completed
1. Ignore command for player chat, so you can lock out seeing chat from certain players.
5. Persistent player data, either by server or by a GDS of some sort, with stats and website.
6. Match mode values, with display to show what values have been changed.
7. Vote options for earthquakes, lighting, rail speed, gravity (lighting is already available to admins, I will add the earthquakes in and make them available via cvar&#39;s and admin options as well).
8. Colored contrails (red/blue).
9. Overhaul the iddist function, make it like the one I wrote for Lasermine2.
10. Also from Lasermine2, add the flashlight, flares, and nukes, all admin configurable naturally.
11. Options for runes.
12. Look closer at server messages, such as player entry, team kills, etc, do some overhauling.
13. Another Lasermine thing, the spam cannon. I overhauled it for Lasermine2, and had many suggestions on this one. Also, an option for making spam control apply to team chat as well.
14. For server admins, create a CSV file of player names and the IP&#39;s they use.
15. Put in a system to allow players to play sounds on their team&#39;s computer via binds (some mods have this already, just can&#39;t remember which, it&#39;s been so long.) Would also have spam control on it to prevent players from annoying teammates, and since the sounds would be client side players can change the files to say what they want.
16. I know it&#39;s crazy, but I actually got several requests for the sticky hook to come back :P It&#39;ll be a server admin option, possibly a vote, too.
17. Another vote: Player Kick.
18. CVARs for point values, of course there will be defaults, but I may also add something like a gametype of &quot;Kill the Carrier&quot; or &quot;Defend the Base&quot; where you get bonus points for thoe types of kills. I think this could really add some fun to the game and mix things up a little.  With the gametypes I could make it harder to get those points, such as make the player shoot the flag carrier twice, or players in the base be stealth, or something. 
19. There was talk of colored chat messages. This will almost absolutely have to be a client side exe modification in conjunction with the dll to work. Not sure how likely it is this one will be done.
20. There&#39;s arguments over the spawn protection. I plan on making a flag for it so that admins can handle it the way they want, either by time, if they get shot once it disappears, or if they use the hook or rail it disappears, or they cannot shoot until their protection is off. Maybe make the respanwed player get thrown when he is hit but not affect the protect. Also, make a CVAR for flag carriers to be able to shoot through the protection. 
22. Change around the maplist a bit, put in a value for whether or not that particular map can be voted on, and maybe how likely the map is to come up in the rotation.
23. This one goes way back: bonus for evening teams. Keep your score, get a bonus, whatever. It&#39;s been on my mind since the beginning but I&#39;ve never actually worked on it.
24. Hook gravity CVAR, everyone knows how that went over, so I&#39;ll make it a CVAR and let you play with it.
25. In the ops file, add the name and IP of the person who promoted or demoted an op. There is some other reworking that needs to be done here as well.
26. no_hum CVAR, make it global.
27. Various bugs and security issues, which I won&#39;t descirbe here for obvious reasons. 
28. Private chat function, so players can send messages to specific people and set up a group of people to send chat to.
29. Option for ricochet slugs.
30. Add a speedometer of sorts to the HUD.
