CHANGELOG FOR TMG_MOD

r32:
Fixed double+ rails to check to see if player hit was an enemy before adding it to number of players hit.
Fixed yes votes not clearing on mapvote fail.
Fixed oplist/listops command to display ops correctly.
Added sounds for double+ rails and some more sounds sprees/headshots.
Added "rconmode" admin command for binding a key to enter rcon commands in messagemode.
Added displaying of maplist for available maps to vote on when client types mapvote with no option.

r36:
Changed yes/no vote commands to not set the client's vote to yes or no until a vote is in progress.
Added new CVAR: 'cfgdir'. You may want to run multiple servers from the same directory. This allows you to set
  those servers up independently. Please note that you must have a logs, nav, ent, and hs folder in each cfg directory. This
  is changed to read from cfg directory instead of the game directory. Also the bot_detected.txt is now bot_detected.log
  and will be in your logs directory. Also this is a noset cvar and must be set from the command line when starting the server.
Mapvoting is now available via client menu. Also choosing yes or no to vote is in same menu.
Fixed mapvote client command to not exec during map voting for end of level.
Added End of Level map change vote to client menu.

r37:
Debugging step build

r38:
Fixed highscores causing a crash in Linux servers with long map names.

r39:
Fixed map nicks being too long screwing up op and vote maplist menus.

r40-42:
Code/SVN Repo Maintenance

r??
QwazyWabbit
Added "hscores" command so user can see highscores of current map at will.
Added cvars highscores and show_highscores.
Cvar highscores enables highscore command and display. Default: true
Cvar show_highscores enables display at intermission. Default: false
Improved highscore management and added some diagnostics.
Added DbgPrintf function that outputs to debugger in Windows if a debugger 
is present and debug builds or prints to server console and log file on 
non-Windows systems if developer cvar is set.
Bumped game version to 2.12.

0.2.15
Added efficiency stats to HUD in player and chase modes.
Eff is displayed as percentage and also as ratio of frags/shots fired.
Fixed match countdown timer format so it's always double digits.
Added flag_bonus and flag_return_time cvars.
Fix deathmatch join. Fix highscores display at intermission and on command in DM.
Fixed mapvote. Solo player on a server full of bots can now vote a map change.
Some bot code maintenance. Removed useless global NumBotsInGame maintenance.
Improved/renamed GetNumBots().
Changed names of cvars: map_change, map_randomize, map_once, map_debug.
Fixed WallFly blockout.
HUD motd now shows for 3 seconds and then closes, spawning player as spectator.
Change <SPECTATOR> to <SPEC> for WallFly compatibility. Some code style changes.
Moved CTFCalcScores and SaveHighScores calls into BeginIntermission
just prior to moving all clients to intermission.

0.2.16
Add tracking of flag captures to player HUD. Planning to add captures to scoreboard display.

0.2.17
Added flag capture count per player to CTF scoreboard. 
Added cvar support, "newscore" for admin configuration of preferred scoreboard.

0.2.18
Add server option to display scoreboard on death. Default to off. ctf_deathscores

0.2.19
Fixed map rotation bugs.

0.2.20
Added log file management. (log_manager.c)
Cvars added:
logfile_name        // the server or qconsole.log file
logfile            // the logfile mode control
logfile_rename    // how often we rename the server log file
0 = never, 1 = daily, 2 = weekly, 3 = monthly, default: 2

0.2.21
Fixed bot spawn file parser error reporting.
Various technical code changes.

0.2.22
Edits to makefiles. Created GNUmakefile & BSDmakefile.
Added tracking of hooks deployed and hooks landed for stats logging.

0.2.23
Fix suicide messages.
Fix hooks crashing server when player kills himself or disconnects while hooking.
Test code for fixing hook spamming of server.
Add "ver" command for printing of version and build information in game.

0.2.24
Add HUD documentation about how HUD placements are determined. (from LOX code)
Relocate banner to its own header to allow edit and continue in VS.
Delete banner from g_local.h.
Eliminate unneeded catching of hook spamming.
Send message to user if he uses kill command that it's prevented.
Note: the trapping of kill commands seems to be there to prevent bogus player
state when switching from active to dead player. The game puts him into
chase mode instead of dead.

Add some debugging output to the spawnpoint searches.

0.2.25

Fixed bugs in original and new CTFScoreboardMessages.
Fix ancient bug where "Spectators" block was sent twice in the same scoreboard message.

Fix bug in mdsoft_NextMap that prevented 0th map in list being selected.
Other non-functional changes.
Removed last vestiges of isop, ismop and op variables.
Now client->pers.oplevel handles all op qualifications. Only one variable to maintain.
Added bot ON/OFF command to OP_Menu. Operators have this command if they have OP_PLAYERCONTROL permission.

Fix bug where highscores weren't showing up in intermission.
Expanded bot control menu.

0.2.28
Cleaning up STAT_* constants.
Trimming size of deathmatch scoreboard message.
Add "location" command and display the player's location in his HUD.
Type location in console and the location info toggles on/off.


Completed
2. Player name on freecam was fixed, but I may have to fix it again so it's still on the list.
3. Same with bug in lockteams on the admin menu.
4. Make highscores available anytime via a console cmd.
21. Kill/Death counter. I did this once already but think it needs done again.
26. no_hum CVAR, make it global.

Not Completed
1. Ignore command for player chat, so you can lock out seeing chat from certain players.
5. Persistent player data, either by server or by a GDS of some sort, with stats and website.
6. Match mode values, with display to show what values have been changed.
7. Vote options for earthquakes, lighting, rail speed, gravity (lighting is already available to admins, I will add the earthquakes in and make them available via cvar's and admin options as well).
8. Colored contrails (red/blue).
9. Overhaul the iddist function, make it like the one I wrote for Lasermine2.
10. Also from Lasermine2, add the flashlight, flares, and nukes, all admin configurable naturally.
11. Options for runes.
12. Look closer at server messages, such as player entry, team kills, etc, do some overhauling.
13. Another Lasermine thing, the spam cannon. I overhauled it for Lasermine2, and had many suggestions on this one. Also, an option for making spam control apply to team chat as well.
14. For server admins, create a CSV file of player names and the IP's they use.
15. Put in a system to allow players to play sounds on their team's computer via binds (some mods have this already, just can't remember which, it's been so long.) Would also have spam control on it to prevent players from annoying teammates, and since the sounds would be client side players can change the files to say what they want.
16. I know it's crazy, but I actually got several requests for the sticky hook to come back :P It'll be a server admin option, possibly a vote, too.
17. Another vote: Player Kick.
18. CVARs for point values, of course there will be defaults, but I may also add something like a gametype of "Kill the Carrier" or "Defend the Base" where you get bonus points for those types of kills. I think this could really add some fun to the game and mix things up a little.  With the gametypes I could make it harder to get those points, such as make the player shoot the flag carrier twice, or players in the base be stealth, or something. 
19. There was talk of colored chat messages. This will almost absolutely have to be a client side exe modification in conjunction with the dll to work. Not sure how likely it is this one will be done.
20. There's arguments over the spawn protection. I plan on making a flag for it so that admins can handle it the way they want, either by time, if they get shot once it disappears, or if they use the hook or rail it disappears, or they cannot shoot until their protection is off. Maybe make the respawned player get thrown when he is hit but not affect the protect. Also, make a CVAR for flag carriers to be able to shoot through the protection. 
22. Change around the maplist a bit, put in a value for whether or not that particular map can be voted on, and maybe how likely the map is to come up in the rotation.
23. This one goes way back: bonus for evening teams. Keep your score, get a bonus, whatever. It's been on my mind since the beginning but I've never actually worked on it.
24. Hook gravity CVAR, everyone knows how that went over, so I'll make it a CVAR and let you play with it.
25. In the ops file, add the name and IP of the person who promoted or demoted an op. There is some other reworking that needs to be done here as well.
27. Various bugs and security issues, which I won't describe here for obvious reasons. 
28. Private chat function, so players can send messages to specific people and set up a group of people to send chat to.
29. Option for ricochet slugs.
30. Add a speedometer of sorts to the HUD.
